// If your class produces objects that never change, you can make these objects compile-time constants. To do this, define a const constructor and make sure that all instance variables are final.
class ImmutablePoint {
  const ImmutablePoint(this.x, this.y);

  final int x;
  final int y;

  static const ImmutablePoint origin = ImmutablePoint(0, 0);
}

// Code example
// Modify the Recipe class so its instances can be constants, and create a constant constructor that does the following:
// - Has three parameters: ingredients, calories, and milligramsOfSodium (in that order).
// - Uses this. syntax to automatically assign the parameter values to the object properties of the same name.
// - Is constant, with the const keyword just before Recipe in the constructor declaration.
// - Ignore all initial errors in the DartPad.
class Recipe {
  final List<String> ingredients;
  final int calories;
  final double milligramsOfSodium;

  const Recipe(this.ingredients, this.calories, this.milligramsOfSodium);
}
